## Fizzbuzz

This file contains a simple program that takes a number as a parameter, and either returns:
  (1) The number itself;
  (2) "Fizz" for multiples of 3;
  (3) "Buzz" for multiples of 5; or
  (4) "Fizzbuzz" for multiples of 15. 
It can also be used to print the numbers 1 to 100, with Fizz, Buzz, and Fizzbuzz in place of the multiples described above.

This code is written in Ruby and was for the purpose of practicing pairing remotely.
